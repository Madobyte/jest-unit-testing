# Dev's Reflection

This repo's purpose is to exercise unit testing using Jest. I realized that Unit Testing is important in the development process as it can catch any bug or error early.

It ensures that the code functions properly and meets specifications. It saves resources such as time and money because it guarantees smooth development rather than wasting resources on debugging.
